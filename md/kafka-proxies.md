# Kafka Proxies

The kafka proxies are tools that simplify the communication between a component and kafka through a non-kafka protocol.

Confluent provides a couple of proxies. It is important to mention that these tools are used when the use case is simple 
enough. Generally when you need a lot of control over clients, using proxies is not recommended.
